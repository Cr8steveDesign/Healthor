          <h3 className="sub-heading">The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            In an age where online searches for health-related queries are
            prevalent, the reliability and relevance of information can be a
            significant challenge. Traditional search engines often prioritize
            popularity over accuracy, leading to misinformation and confusion
            among users.
          </p>

          <h3 className="sub-heading">Bridging The Gap</h3>
